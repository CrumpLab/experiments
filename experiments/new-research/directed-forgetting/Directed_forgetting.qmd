## Background

This is a replication of experiment 1 from @ahmad2019. In brief, participants were presented with 120 pictures of natural scenes. Each picture was presented for two seconds, followed randomly by the letter F or R for three seconds.

When you see the letter F, the instructions are to "FORGET" the previous image. When you see the letter R, the instructions are to "REMEMBER" the previous image. At the end of the encoding phase, participants are given a recognition memory test for all of the pictures they saw.

A general purpose of this task is to measure people's ability to intentionally forget versus remember information. Most prior research into this ability used word stimuli, which are known to be generally less memorable that picture stimuli. A more specific purpose is to examine whether people are capable of intentionally forgetting pictures, and if so, to determine what aspects of picture information may be forgotten.

The study we are replicating was previously conducted by participants who visited a lab in person. The current study is an attempt to replicate the previous findings in an online population.
