## Information

This experiment involves a memory test for words. Here's what to expect:

1. You will be shown a consent form and asked to fill out basic demographic information
2. There are two parts to the task. 

- In the study phase you will be shown about 40 words, one at a time. Each word will be paired with a question that asks you judge a property of the word (by clicking yes or no with your mouse).
- In the memory test you will be asked to remember as many words as you can by writing by them into a text box.
