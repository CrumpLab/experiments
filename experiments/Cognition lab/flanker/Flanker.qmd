## Background

This is a replication of @eriksen1974. The task involves responding to a target letter as quickly and accurately as possible. Importantly, the target letter may be "flanked" by distractor letters presented on both sides of the target.

A general question was whether responses to the target letter would be influenced by the presence of distracting letter.
