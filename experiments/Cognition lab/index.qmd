This section contains cognition experiments intended mostly for educational purposes, although they may eventually serve some research purpose. 

Most the experiments in this section are designed as a companion to Dr. Crump's [Introduction to Cognitive Psychology course](https://crumplab.com/cognition/). The goal is to have online demo experiments that students can complete for each learning module in the course.

Participating in a demo experiment is a great way to learn more about a particular finding in cognition. It will help you understand what it is was like to be a participant in the study, and this will help you better understand the meaning of findings associated with the study.
